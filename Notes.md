# Current Dev Plans: (very fluid and changeable)

Begin implementing a config settings window:

* allow users to update config properties, and have those changes reflected in the editor
Window with several panels:

Text / Layout / Background / Save&Load

Also allow for separate config profiles, save and load .properties files

Implement a Version Viewer that grabs all of the version files and lists them side by side (like draft)
Uses a horizontal scrollbar

Background images + music

Use toolbars for UI instead of ribbon to get rid of that dependency. Transparent toolbars with image icons, use Trident to fade in and out on mouse move and typing

Toolbars: Writing, Space (bg + music)
