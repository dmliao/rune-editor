# Current Dev Plans:

Implement Autosaving:

## Save New Version method:

* allow users to save files as new version, and continue editing the original version
* Save new version - Ctrl-Shift-N
* set up autosaving, allow users to autosave every few minutes
* Create a viewer window to compare all of the versions in the same folder (eventually)

Begin implementing a config settings window:

* allow users to update config properties, and have those changes reflected in the editor
Window with several panels:

Text / Layout / Background / Save&Load

Also allow for separate config profiles, save and load .properties files :3
