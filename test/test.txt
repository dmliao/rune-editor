Chapter 2: 
Know Table 2.3
	names of simple irons
Table 2.4
	names of transition metal compounds (e.g. Fe(II)Cl2)
	Use Roman numerals to display how many electrons are donated
Table 2.5
	More complex ions (e.g. NH4+ = ammonium, OH- = hydroxide)

What is chemistry? Study of matter and the change in matter

C2H5OH ethanol
Moles->Mass, use atomic masses and multiply by Avogadro's # (molar mass = mass of one mole)
Mass->Moles, figure out the mass of one mole and divide out the mass

If you're given percents:
38.67 % carbon
16.23 % hydrogen
45.10 $ nitrogen

Assume you have 100g of substance, so 38.67 g carbon, etc.
Then divide them out by the molar mass of each element, to figure out the proportions in moles

3.22 mole C
16.10 mole H
3.22 mole N

Formula is CH5N.

Benzene: C6H6 - molecular formula
CH - empirical formula (simplified)

Chemical Equations - matter MUST be conserved!
Need to balance chemical reactions.

reactants -> products

CH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)
Stoichiometric Reaction!

### Example ###
Combustion of Propane yields CO2 and H2O (remember: combustion means reacting with oxygen!)

What mass of O2 is needed to burn 96.1 g of propane?
Propane = C3H8

Get the chemical equation:
C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) -> 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)
# moles C3H8 = 96.1g/molar mass C3H8(44.1g/mole) = 2.18 moles

We need 5x the # moles C3H8 of O2, so we'll need 10.9 moles of O2...now we have to find the mass of that.
10.9 moles * 32 g/mole = 349 grams of O2

Remember, always:
1. Read the question
2. Check your work
